# Tillage-16SrRNA-MiSeq
Samples were collected over two summers from the long-term tillage experiment at Rock Springs, PA. The tillage treatments were set up in 1978 and were in continuous corn until 2004 at which point the rotation changed to a corn-soybean-small grain & cover crop 3-year rotation. I collected samples from the corn entry in 2018 and soybean entry in 2019. Samples included bulk soils and rhizosphere soils and were taken at three different growth stages for both the corn and soybean. All samples were sequenced with the 515F/806R primer set on an Illumina MiSeq. Included here is the metadata and the code used for the analyses. 

Raw sequence data is available at NCBI under BioProject PRJNA690554.
